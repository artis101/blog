Hello! This is my first blog post. I hope you enjoy it. 

However it's not entirely true. I have written many posts before. But this is the first one that I'm writing with the intent of writing and not caring if someone reads it or not. Writing is hard. Writing requires discipline, and I haven't been able to discipline myself to write over the past decade. I hope that will change with practice.

## What is this blog about?

This is my blog about the things I learn and like. I write about programming, DIY electronics, microcontrollers and cars. Sometimes I write whatever I feel like writing. I hope you enjoy it. 

## Not too long, not too short

A good blog post is like a good joke. Not too long, not too short, delivers the punchline and makes you think. A weekend project can be a good blog post, and writing a good blog post can be a good weekend project. Putting arbitrary constraints on yourself can be good to get going, but it can also be limiting. Working in IT always feels like a balancing act, you're always limited by deadlines, there's always a promise made to someone, an OKR to meet and a feature to ship...

This is my safe space. It's safe from constraints and obligations, but it's also my commitment to myself. To write, to share and to learn. This is also a piece of the old internet, where I grew up. It was small, distributed and small websites meant a lot more. I hope to bring some of that back.

Welcome to my blog, I hope you enjoy it and come back.
