Hi, my name is Artis Avotins. I am a software engineer from Latvia. I'm currently employed at Workday, where I work as a Senior Software Development Engineer. Everything here is my own opinion and does not represent my employer.

## Technologies that I use at work:
- React
- TypeScript
- GraphQL
- Ruby and Rails
- PostgreSQL
- Docker
- Linux
- Distributed systems

## Technologies I pick for my personal projects:
- C++/Arduino for hardware projects
- Python (Django, Flask) for web development
- Node.js for backend(express.js, socket.io)
- React for frontend or any flavor/framework like preact, svelte, next.js, blitz.js, nuxt.js, vite
- PostgreSQL for databases
- Linux for servers
- Docker for containerization

## Technologies I have had contract work with:
- WASM for performance-critical parts and interfacing with cryptography libraries
- Web3.js for interfacing with Ethereum blockchain, smart contracts and browser wallets
- C# for a utility tool running on Windows

## Who am I outside of work?
I also have a bunch of hobbies outside of work. These hobbies mostly involve outdoor activities, such as swimming, hiking, camping and cycling. I live up north, so during winter time I tinker with electronics, build stuff and play video games. I enjoy simulation games, especially VR flight simulators.

This page is a collection of my thoughts, projects, and other things I find interesting. Feel free to reach out to me if you have any questions or just want to chat.
