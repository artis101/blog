      <h2 id="about_me_grid" class="gol-header micro5">About me</h2>
      <p>
        I'm a generalist with over 20 years of experience in the software
        industry. I have worked for companies of all sizes, from small startups
        to large corporations, and have been a founder as well.
      </p>
      <p>
        My technology stack of choice is Python or JavaScript for the backend,
        and React for the frontend. PostgreSQL is my preferred database. I have
        experience with Django, Flask, Express, Next.js, and DRF for backend
        development. For frontend, I work with React, Preact, or vanilla JS. I
        prefer TypeScript for all my JavaScript projects.
      </p>
      <p>
        I am proficient in Linux and comfortable with the command line. My daily
        OS is either MacOS or Arch Linux. I prefer using Docker and Nix. I have
        been hosting my own services on a $5 VPS for years.
      </p>
      <p>
        Throughout my career I have worked as a contractor, an individual
        contributor and have been an engineering manager as well.
      </p>
      <p>
        That's my professional life summed up in five paragraphs. Feel free to
        look arouind the site to learn more about me.
